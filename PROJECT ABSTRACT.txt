Abstract: -
Coronavirus is a transmissible virus that causes breathing droplets, and it leads to death. 
It is infected from others by talking, coughing, and sneezing. 
Interaction between the infected person or through touching a contaminated surface and object 
can spread the virus rapidly. The best way to prevent it by infecting is to wear a mask 
that covers nose and mouth when we are at crowded places.  It is not possible to watch every 
single person whether they are wearing a mask or not. so, we can use the detection of face mask in cameras.
 Deep Learning technologies is well known in recognition and classification by processing images.
 (The research study uses deep learning techniques that identify if the person is wearing a facemask or 
not and check if the persons in the area observe physical distancing. The collected image data contains
 1,000 images, uniformly crop images in 224x224 pixels, and attained an accuracy rate of 97% during
 the training of the model. The developed system is implemented using Python and CNN through TensorFlow 
that recognizes persons wearing a facemask or not wearing. This study is helpful in controlling the 
spread of the virus and avoiding contact with the virus.)
